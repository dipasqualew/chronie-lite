---Whether a thing that just happened is worth a photograph, and what the photograph is of.
---
---The decision and nothing else. This module presses no shutter, writes no entry and holds
---no frame: it is handed something the tally has already been told about and answers with a
---trigger name and a subject, or with nothing. Everything it needs to say no — the
---allowlist, the clock, whether the world is on screen — arrives as a dependency, which is
---what lets the rules be tested without a client.
---
---Three separate reasons to say no, and they are not the same reason:
---
---* **The trigger is not allowed.** The allowlist is the player's, not Chronie's. Every
---  rule below offers its candidate names most specific first, so somebody who wants a
---  picture of every achievement and somebody who wants one only of an account first are
---  both expressible, and neither is the default.
---* **One was taken too recently.** Clearing an old raid fires thirty achievements in a
---  minute, and thirty pictures of the same corridor is a mess rather than a memory. The
---  limiter counts automatic captures only: a player holding the keybinding down is doing
---  something deliberate, and being told no by a rule they did not press is not helpful.
---  It is a rate limit across moments and nothing else — several events belonging to *one*
---  moment are collapsed a layer up, by `ns.newCaptureBurst`, before the shutter is reached.
---  Keeping the two apart is what lets this cooldown be loosened without a boss kill turning
---  back into four photographs of itself.
---* **The world is not on screen.** Events fire during loading screens and cinematics, and
---  the picture that comes back is a black rectangle. The obstruction is tracked by name
---  because two of them can overlap — a cinematic that ends in a loading screen — and the
---  world is back only once every one of them has lifted.

---What happened, as the handler that folded it into the tally already knows it.
---@class CaptureEvent
---@field kind string Which of the rules below to ask: "achievement", "levelUp", "mount",
---"pet", "toy", "keystone" or "transmog".
---@field id integer? The achievement, mount, pet species, toy or item the event was about.
---@field accountFirst boolean? For an achievement: nobody on this account had it before.
---@field onTime boolean? For a keystone: the run beat the timer.
---@field newAppearance boolean? For a transmog: the look is new to the collection rather
---than another item that wears one already owned.

---What a capture would be, when one is worth taking.
---
---Only `trigger` and `achievement` are ever written to an entry. The other two describe the
---decision rather than the photograph, and exist so `ns.newCaptureBurst` can tell two
---decisions apart when a single moment fires several: see `displaces` there for what it
---does with them.
---@class CaptureDecision
---@field trigger string The allowed rule that fired, which is filed with the entry so a
---reader can tell an automatic capture from a pressed one and say why it happened.
---@field achievement integer? The achievement this hangs off, when that is what fired it.
---An explicit field per subject kind rather than a kind/id pair: there will only ever be a
---handful, and downstream the link is a real foreign key that a polymorphic column could
---not be.
---@field kind string The event kind this came out of, carried through unchanged.
---@field rank integer Where the matched name sat in that kind's candidate list, 1 being the
---most specific. Comparable only against another decision of the same kind.

---@class CaptureTriggers
---@field consider fun(event: CaptureEvent): CaptureDecision? What to capture, or nil.
---@field taken fun() Records that a capture actually happened, starting the limiter. Called
---by the caller rather than by consider, because the entry log has refusals of its own and
---a minute of silence should not be spent on a picture that was never taken.
---@field obscured fun(reason: string, active: boolean) Whether something is between the
---player and the world right now.
---@field visible fun(): boolean Whether the world is on screen, for anyone who wants to say.

---@class CaptureTriggersDeps
---@field triggers string[]? The rule names the player allows. Absent or empty means
---automatic capture is off entirely, which is a legitimate thing to want.
---@field now fun(): integer
---@field cooldownSeconds integer? Seconds between two automatic captures. Default 60.

---Long enough that a raid clear's worth of achievements is one photograph rather than
---thirty, short enough that two genuinely separate moments in an evening both get one.
local DEFAULT_COOLDOWN = 60

---Which trigger names each kind of event can satisfy, most specific first, and what an
---event has to be for the specific one to be offered to it at all.
---
---A list rather than a single name so that the specific and the general are both
---expressible: an account-first achievement is offered as the account-first rule and then as
---the plain one, so allowing either is enough to photograph it, and allowing only the
---account-first rule leaves the other twenty-nine achievements of a raid clear alone. An
---event that fails `specific` is offered the general names only, which is what makes
---"every achievement" and "only the ones nobody on this account had" two different lists.
---
---The position of a name in its own list is the rank the decision carries. It is a property
---of the list rather than of the event, which matters: a plain achievement and an account
---first are both `achievement` rank 2 for a player who allowed only the general rule, and a
---moment holding both is decided by arrival order rather than by one of them accidentally
---looking more specific than the other.
---
---Nothing here needs an event Chronie was not already listening to. That is deliberate: a
---second set of listeners for events the tally already handles is how the two drift apart.
