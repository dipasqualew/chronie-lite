---What the panel says when it is pointed at, which is the account's answer to the row's own
---question. The panel itself only ever reports the segment just played — the gain, not the
---balance, and this character, not the roster — because those are the two largest numbers it
---could put on a small frame and neither is news. Hovering is where the rest of it lives:
---the same figure widened out to every character the account has, which is a question worth
---asking about a currency and a faction and worth nothing at all until it is asked.
---
---Pure, and paired with `ResultsWindow` the way every frame here is paired with a module:
---the panel knows how to draw a tooltip and nothing about what belongs in one.

---Groups a count's digits in threes, because a reputation bar reads in five figures and an
---unbroken run of them is unreadable at this font size.
---
---Shared with the panel rather than kept there because the bar caption and the tooltip over
---it are two readings of the same number: `6,000 / 12,000` under the faction and
---`6,000 / 12,000` beside a character's name have to be the same string, or the tooltip reads
---as a different measurement rather than a wider view of the same one.

---A standing as it reads on the right of a line: the level's name, then how far into it.
---
---Deliberately the bar's caption, character for character. A faction the client would name
---but not place has only the name; one it would place but not name has only the numbers; one
---it could say nothing at all about is the honest "unknown" rather than an empty column that
---would read as a missing line.

---being played.

---
---Dropped only while it stays unambiguous. Two alts of the same name on two realms are
---ordinary on a warband, and shortening both to "Alt" would put two rows in the list that
---cannot be told apart — so the moment a short name is claimed twice, every row goes back to
---the full "Name-Realm" rather than only the pair that collided, because a list where some
---rows carry a realm and others do not reads as a list of different kinds of thing.

---
---Deliberately answered without knowing who is playing. `ns.bestStanding` folds the live reading

---What the whole account holds of one currency, as a tooltip.
---
---The panel deliberately reports only what the segment earned, because a balance is not news
---and the largest number on a small frame should not be the one that never changes. But
---"+250" is unanswerable on its own — whether it is worth walking back for depends entirely
---on what is already banked, and on whether this character's own row is the only one that
---counts. So the balance lives here, where it is asked for rather than always on screen.
---
---The total is recomputed rather than taken from `rollup.total`, for the same reason the
---crown is above: the rollup was summed over stored holdings, and the character being played
---has spent or earned since the one it wrote down. Adding the stored row to the live one
---counts that character twice.
---
---A warband-wide currency is not summed at all. The client answers every character with the
---account's one shared balance, so the per-character rows are a single number reported over
---and over — adding them multiplies the pot by the size of the roster, and listing them draws
---the same figure once per alt. The freshest reading is the whole answer, and the roster is
---left off entirely because there is nothing in it to tell apart.
