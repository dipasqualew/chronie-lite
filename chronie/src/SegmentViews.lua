---One thing the results panel can be pointed at: the session's running total, the segment
---being played right now, or one that already closed during this session.
---@class SegmentView
---@field kind string "session", "live" or "record".
---@field key string Identity of the view, stable while it is reachable.
---@field title string What the panel's header says while this view is on screen.
---@field label string What the picker calls it: whose segment it was and where, or "Session".
---@field detail string The metadata beside that label — when a segment happened, or how many
---segments the evening holds. Two runs of the same dungeon on the same character are the same
---label twice, and this is what tells them apart.
---@field summary SegmentSummary What to draw. A filed record is summary-shaped already,
---which is why one can be handed to the same panel a live tally is.
---@field current boolean Whether this is the view the panel is standing on, so the picker
---can tick the one already being looked at.

---Everything the panel can be pointed at, and which one it is standing on.
---
---Ordered the way the menu reads: the session total on top, set apart from the rest,
---and then the evening itself running forwards — the oldest segment first and the one
---being played last, because that is the order the evening happened in and the segment
---at the bottom of the list is the one the player is in right now. The panel opens on
---that last one, because it is what somebody glancing at a HUD is asking about; the
---picker is what reaches anything else.
---
---Where they are left is where they stay, with one exception: a segment opening pulls the
---panel forward onto it, the way a damage meter jumps to the pull that just started. A
---player parked on a segment that finished twenty minutes ago is looking at history, and
---history is not what a HUD is for once something new is happening. The session total is
---the exception to the exception — parking there is a deliberate "show me the evening", and
---the evening is still the evening after a loading screen.
---
---"This session" is the same evening the desktop app draws: the segment being played, and
---every earlier one that chains back to it across a gap of no more than five minutes,
---whichever character played it. That rule lives in `apps/desktop/src/sessions.ts` as
---SESSION_GAP_SECONDS, and it is repeated here rather than invented afresh, because a panel
---that called an evening one thing while the app it feeds called it another would be worse
---than either. It also means a reload does not fork the evening in half: the log survives
---one, so the chain walks straight back through it.
---@class SegmentViews
---@field selected fun(): SegmentView What the panel should be drawing.
---@field list fun(): SegmentView[] The whole list, in order, for a picker to draw. Named
---and dated but not added up: the menu wants to say what is on offer, not compute it.
---@field select fun(key: string): SegmentView Stand on the view with that key. An unknown
---key leaves the panel where it is, which is what a stale menu row asking for a segment
---that has since been pruned should do.

---@class SegmentViewsDeps
---@field liveSummary fun(): SegmentSummary The running tally of the open segment.
---@field liveLocation fun(): string? Where that segment is being played, when one is open.
---@field liveStart fun(): integer? When the open segment began, which is where the walk
---back through the evening starts from.
---@field segments fun(): SegmentRecord[] Everything the log holds.
---@field character fun(): string "Name-Realm" of whoever is playing.
---@field now fun(): integer

---The silence that ends an evening. Five minutes is long enough to cover a loading screen,
---and it is SESSION_GAP_SECONDS out of `apps/desktop/src/sessions.ts` — the same number
---because it is the same rule, not because both happened to pick five.

---
---Two things a segment carries have nowhere to go here and are deliberately dropped. A
