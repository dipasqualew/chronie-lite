---What the account holds of one thing, as one row of a census.
---
---`seen` is when the walk last looked at this id, and it is what makes a finished pass able to
---drop what is no longer held: everything a completed pass did not touch is older than the
---pass that just ran. Every other field belongs to the domain that wrote it.
---@class CensusEntry
---@field seen integer Epoch seconds.

---One domain's standing: what is held, and how much of a claim that is.
---@class CensusState
---@field entries table<integer, CensusEntry> Keyed by the client's own id for the thing.
---@field held integer How many entries there are, kept beside them so an audit is a comparison
---rather than a walk.
---@field complete boolean Whether `entries` is the whole of what the account holds. **This is
---the only field that licenses a reader to treat an absence as a removal.**
---@field revision integer Bumped every time a pass finishes. A reader that has already seen
---this revision has already seen these entries.
---@field startedAt integer? When the pass that produced this began.
---@field completedAt integer? When it finished; nil while one is running or was abandoned.
---@field by string? Which character walked it, for an account-wide domain.
---@field build string? The client build it was walked on. A patch invalidates a census, and
---this is what says which one it was taken against.
---@field counted integer? What the client's own counter said at the moment the pass finished.
---Nil for a domain whose client offers no counter.

---A kind of thing a census can be taken of.
---
---A domain is three seams and a name, and every one of them is the client's own answer rather
---than anything worked out here. That is what makes adding the next domain an adapter rather
---than a change to this file.
---@class CensusDomain
---@field name string What the domain is called in the file. Stable: it is a key readers join on.
---@field scope "account"|"character" Which of the two a reading belongs to. An account domain is
---one every character reports the same answer for — mounts, appearances, achievements — and is
---kept once. A character domain is kept per `Name-Realm`, the way `HoldingsStore` keeps holdings.
---@field list fun(): any[]? Every position the walk should visit, in whatever the domain finds
---cheapest to enumerate. Nil — not an empty list — when this client build will not answer at
---all, which leaves the last census standing rather than replacing it with an empty one.
---
---A position is not always an id, and that is the point. The mount journal hands over its ids
---outright, so a mount's position *is* its id; the achievement tree has no id list at all and
---is walked by category and offset, so an achievement's position is an index into a plan the
---domain drew up. What the two have in common is that building the list is arithmetic and a
---handful of calls, never the walk itself — the walk is what the budget below exists to spread
---out, and a `list` that did it would freeze the client for exactly as long as this avoids.
---@field read fun(position: any): (integer?, table?) The id at that position, and what the
---account holds of it — or nothing for a position that holds nothing. **Only what is held is
---written down**: the catalogue of what exists lives in the game's own tables, which the desktop
---reads, so a census that also recorded every absence would be several times the size and say
---nothing more.
---@field count fun(): integer? The client's own count of what is held, in one call. Nil for a
---domain whose client offers none. See `audit`.
---@field partial boolean? Whether the most a pass over this domain can ever be is *part* of the
---answer.
---
---Every other domain here asks the client a question every character answers the same, so a walk
---that visited every position it was given has seen the whole of what the account holds. One does
---not: `ns.appearanceCensus` reads a wardrobe the client will only show through the logged-in
---character's class filter, so a mage's walk is the account's cloth and none of its plate no
---matter how faithfully it runs to the end.
---
---A domain that says so here is treated as what it is — a set of positive observations. **It
---never claims completeness and is never pruned**, which is the same standing an interrupted pass
---already has and which `docs/account-census.md` lists as the "character that can only see part of
---what the account owns" case. And it is **never settled by an audit**: the next character is a
---different part of the answer, so there is always a reason to walk again. That is what makes the
---union across the roster happen at all, and it is affordable for the same reason it is necessary
---— the domain that needs it is the one no client event feeds between passes.

---@class Census
---@field audit fun(): string[] Which domains look wrong without walking them.
---@field start fun(names: string[]?): string[] Begin a pass over these domains, or over every

---The account-level schema version, which is **not** `segmentSchemaVersion`.
---
---The two feeds evolve on their own timetables and share nothing but a file. `docs/saved-variables.md`
---already says the segment version belongs only to the segment feed; this is the other half of
---that sentence, and keeping them apart is what stops a new domain here forcing a version bump
---that makes every reader re-import every segment.

    ---What the domain says it holds, against what we have written down.
    ---
    ---This is the whole reason a census does not need to be re-run on a timer. Every domain here
    ---is already fed by an event while the addon is loaded — `NEW_MOUNT_ADDED`,
    ---`ACHIEVEMENT_EARNED` and the rest — so between two passes the record stays current by
    ---itself. What the events cannot cover is what happened while nothing was listening: before
    ---Chronie was installed, on another machine's install, in a session a crash took with it, or
    ---across a patch that changed what exists. Every one of those shows up as a count that does
    ---not match, and the client hands the count over for a single call.
    ---
    ---A domain whose client offers no counter is never distrusted by this, because there is
    ---nothing to distrust it with — such a domain is walked only when something else asks.
    ---Three things make a census stale, and none of them is the passing of time.
    ---
    ---**It was never whole.** No pass has ever finished, so there is nothing to trust.
    ---
    ---**The game changed underneath it.** A patch adds mounts, retires achievements and moves
    ---appearances between categories, and a census taken on the build before it is a census of a
    ---different game. The build string is exact, so this costs nothing and never fires spuriously.
    ---
    ---**The client's own count is higher than ours.** Only for a domain whose client offers a
    ---counter — see `ns.censusDomains`, where each one is wired or deliberately left nil. This is
    ---the case that catches what the events cannot: a session a crash took with it, an evening
    ---played on another machine's install, or anything at all that happened before Chronie was
    ---here.
    ---
    ---**Higher, rather than merely different, and that asymmetry is deliberate.** A count above
    ---what is written down means things are missing, which is exactly what a pass is for. A count
    ---*below* it is ambiguous, because the counter need not be counting the same set: the
    ---achievement counter's treatment of guild achievements — which `ns.achievementCensus`
    ---deliberately refuses to record, since they belong to a guild rather than to the account —
    ---could not be settled from the install, and if it does include them then every login of a
    ---guilded character would provoke a full thirteen-thousand-call walk that changes nothing.
    ---A walk that is never provoked when it should have been is a stale reading the next earned
    ---achievement corrects; one provoked every login forever is a tax on every session. **This is
    ---worth confirming against a running client** — `GetNumCompletedAchievements(false)` beside a
    ---finished census of the same account settles it in one comparison.
    ---
    ---A domain that is none of those three needs no pass, because between passes the record keeps
    ---itself: every domain in here is also fed by a client event — `NEW_MOUNT_ADDED`,
    ---`ACHIEVEMENT_EARNED` and the rest — for as long as the addon is loaded.
    ---Whether the reading in hand is one this audit has no reason to go behind.
    ---
    ---For an ordinary domain that is the completeness claim itself: a pass that finished asked
    ---about every id the client named, and a flag still down is a pass a logout cut short.
    ---
    ---A partial domain never carries that claim and so can never be settled by it — and is not
    ---settled by anything else either, deliberately. A walk of it speaks for the character that
    ---took it, the next character is a different part of the answer, and nothing else in the
