---A running tally of the events that happen to one character during one segment:
---a continuous stay in a single location, whether an instance or an open-world zone.
---Pure logic; the only WoW-shaped things it touches arrive as injected seams (item
---prices, transmog collection queries) or as raw chat strings it parses itself.
---
---The tracker owns the segment's boundaries and drives begin()/leave(); this module
---only accumulates whatever lands between them.
---@class SegmentTally
---@field begin fun(money: integer?, currencyItemCounts: table<integer, integer>?) Start a fresh segment,
---anchoring the money baseline and, optionally, the owned-count baseline of each tracked currency item.
---@field leave fun() Stop tallying; the totals survive for one last summary() read.
---@field money fun(current: integer) Fold the current wallet total into loot and net diff.
---@field loot fun(message: string) Add a self-loot chat line's vendor value.
---@field itemInfoReceived fun(itemID: integer) Price the loot that was parked waiting on this
---item's data and fold it in.
---@field reputation fun(message: string) Add a faction-change chat line's gain.
---@field currency fun(currencyType: integer, change: integer, name: string?, total: integer?) Record a
---currency change, and the character's holding of it once the change had landed.
---@field currencyItem fun(itemID: integer, total: integer, name: string?) Fold an item-based currency's
---owned total into the same per-currency tallies, as a change from its segment baseline.
---@field achievement fun(id: integer, name: string?, at: integer, accountFirst: boolean?)
---Append an earned achievement.
---@field levelUp fun(level: integer, at: integer) Append a level gained.
---@field quest fun(id: integer, at: integer, name: string?, characterFirst: boolean?, accountFirst: boolean?)
---Append a completed quest.
---@field transmog fun(event: TransmogEvent) Append a newly collected transmog source.
---@field mount fun(id: integer, name: string?, at: integer) Append a newly collected mount.
---@field pet fun(id: integer, name: string?, at: integer, guid: string?) Append a newly collected battle pet.
---@field toy fun(id: integer, name: string?, at: integer) Append a newly collected toy.
---@field housingItem fun(id: integer, name: string?, at: integer, warbandFirst: boolean?)
---Append a collected housing item.
---@field housingXP fun(amount: integer) Fold a housing experience gain into the segment total.
---@field housingLevelUp fun(level: integer, at: integer) Append a housing level gained.
---@field encounter fun(event: EncounterEvent) Append a boss encounter that ended, kill or wipe.
---@field equipsetChange fun(change: EquipsetChange) Append a change to one equipment set.
---@field entry fun() Note that an entry — a screenshot, a note — was recorded during this
---segment. Counted only so hasEvents() stops calling the segment empty; the entry itself
---lives in its own store, not in the segment.
---@field keystoneStart fun(info: table, at: integer) Open a Mythic+ run: `{ level, mapId, affixes }`.
---@field keystoneComplete fun(info: table, at: integer) Close it: `{ durationMs, onTime, upgrades, level }`.
---@field keystoneReset fun() Abandon the open run; the level and map stay, completion does not.
---@field delveStart fun(state: DelveState, at: integer) Open a delve run, or fold a later
---reading of the client into the one already open.
---@field delveComplete fun(state: DelveState?, at: integer) Mark the open run finished.
---@field experience fun(level: integer, xp: integer, xpMax: integer) Fold the character's
---current experience standing into the segment's gain.
---@field isActive fun(): boolean
---@field hasEvents fun(): boolean Whether anything worth keeping happened this segment.
---@field summary fun(): SegmentSummary

---@class ReputationGain
---@field faction string The localised name the chat line called it, which is all a chat line
---carries and so all this can be grouped by while a segment is open.
---@field id integer? The faction's own id, once the client has been asked where the character
---stands and has answered. **What a standing is filed under downstream** — a name is localised
---and an id is not — so a gain the client would not place carries none, and is not filed.
---@field accountWide boolean? True when the standing is the warband's rather than this
---character's own.
---@field amount integer
---@field standing string? The level the character stood at when it last gained with this
---faction — "Honored", "Renown 12" — when the client had one to report.
---@field current integer? Progress into that level.
---@field max integer? Reputation that level takes to finish.

---@class CurrencyGain
---@field id integer
---@field name string
---@field amount integer Net change over the segment; may be negative.
---@field total integer? The character's holding after the last change seen this segment.

---@class AchievementEvent
---@field id integer
---@field name string
---@field at integer When it was earned.
---@field accountFirst boolean True when this was also the account's first completion.

---@class LevelUpEvent
---@field level integer The new character level.
---@field at integer When the level was gained.

---@class TransmogEvent
---@field id integer Item ID.
---@field sourceID integer? Item modified appearance/source ID.
---@field appearanceID integer? Shared visual appearance ID.
---@field newAppearance boolean True for a new visual; false for another source/variant.
---@field at integer When it was collected.

---@class QuestEvent
---@field id integer Quest ID.
---@field name string? Localised quest title when available.
---@field at integer When it was completed.
---@field characterFirst boolean? True when this character had not completed it before.
---@field accountFirst boolean? True when no character on the account had completed it before.

---@class CollectionEvent
---@field id integer Collection ID (mount ID, pet species ID, or toy item ID).
---@field name string Localised collection entry name.
---@field at integer When it was collected.
---@field guid string? Instance GUID, present for battle pets.
---@field speciesFirst boolean? Pets only: true when the species was not already collected.

---@class HousingItemEvent
---@field id integer Housing catalog entry / item ID.
---@field name string Localised housing item name.
---@field at integer When it was collected.
---@field warbandFirst boolean True when the warband had never collected it; false for a duplicate.

---One boss fight that reached an end, whether the group won it or wiped. Both outcomes are
---kept: a raid night is as much its wipes as its kills, and the ratio is the clearest signal
---there is for telling a progression raid from a farm clear.
---@class EncounterEvent
---@field id integer Encounter (journal) ID.
---@field name string? Localised boss name.
---@field at integer When the fight ended.
---@field difficultyId integer? Difficulty the fight ran on.
---@field groupSize integer? How many players were in the group.
---@field success boolean True for a kill, false for a wipe.

---A Mythic+ run, at most one per segment. A segment is one continuous stay in one instance
---at one difficulty, and a party that finishes a key and immediately starts another one in
---the same dungeon never leaves — so a second run inside a segment overwrites the first
---rather than appending. That is rare, and losing the earlier of two runs beats reporting a
---segment that claims two keystone levels at once.
---@class KeystoneRun
---@field level integer Keystone level the run started on.
---@field mapId integer? Challenge-mode map ID.
---@field affixes integer[]? Affix IDs in effect.
---@field startedAt integer When the key was activated.
---@field completedAt integer? When the dungeon was completed; absent for an abandoned run.
---@field completed boolean Whether the run reached the final boss.
---@field durationMs integer? Clock time the client reported, in milliseconds.
---@field onTime boolean? Whether it beat the timer.
---@field upgrades integer? Keystone upgrade levels earned: 0 for depleted-but-completed, 1..3 otherwise.

---A delve run, at most one per segment, on the same rule a keystone run follows: a party
---that finishes one and walks straight into another never leaves the instance, so the
---second overwrites the first rather than appending.
---@class DelveRun
---@field tier integer? The tier the delve was run at, when the client had one to give.
---@field scenarioId integer? Which of the delve's stories the client rolled. See ns.readDelve.
---@field startedAt integer When the delve was first seen running.
---@field completedAt integer? When it finished; absent for one that was left part way.
---@field completed boolean Whether the delve reached its end.

---How much experience the character earned over the segment.
---@class ExperienceGain
---@field gained integer Raw experience points.
---@field percent number Gain as a fraction of a level: 1.0 is exactly one full level's worth.
---@field startLevel integer Level held when the segment opened.
---@field endLevel integer Level held at the last update seen.

---@class SegmentSummary
---@field active boolean
---@field lootValue integer Vendor value of items entering the inventory, in copper.
---@field goldLooted integer Copper picked up as money.
---@field itemValue integer Summed vendor value of looted items, in copper.
---@field goldDiff integer Net wallet change over the segment, in copper; may be negative.
---@field wallet integer What the wallet holds now, in copper — the balance the diff landed on.
---@field transmogs TransmogEvent[] Newly collected transmog items, in acquisition order.
---@field currencyTotal integer Summed absolute-signed currency change across every currency.
---@field currencies CurrencyGain[] Per-currency totals, sorted by name.
---@field reputationTotal integer Summed reputation gained across every faction.
---@field reputation ReputationGain[] Per-faction totals, sorted by faction name.
---@field achievements AchievementEvent[] Achievements earned, in the order they were.
---@field levelUps LevelUpEvent[] Levels gained, in the order they were.
---@field mounts CollectionEvent[] Mounts collected, in acquisition order.
---@field pets CollectionEvent[] Battle pets collected, in acquisition order.
---@field quests QuestEvent[] Quests completed, in completion order.
---@field toys CollectionEvent[] Toys collected, in acquisition order.
---@field housingItems HousingItemEvent[] Housing items collected, in acquisition order.
---@field housingXP integer Housing experience gained over the segment.
---@field housingLevelUps LevelUpEvent[] Housing levels gained, in the order they were.
---@field encounters EncounterEvent[] Boss fights that ended, in the order they did.
---@field keystone KeystoneRun? The Mythic+ run this segment was, when it was one.
---@field delve DelveRun? The delve this segment was, when it was one.
---@field experience ExperienceGain? Experience earned, when the client ever reported any.

---@class SegmentTallyDeps
---@field lootFormats string[]? Self-loot message templates, most specific first.
---@field factionFormats string[]? Reputation-increase message templates.
---@field itemSellPrice fun(itemID: integer): integer? Vendor price of one item, in copper.
---nil means the client has not cached the item yet — distinct from 0, which means the item
---genuinely cannot be sold.
---@field factionState fun(faction: string): FactionStanding? Where the character stands with
---one faction right now. Absent, or nil for a faction the client cannot place, leaves the
---gain as a bare amount.
---@field bossSavedAsKilled fun(name: string, difficultyId: integer?): boolean? Whether the
---character's own saved-instance state has that boss down. This is the server's account of
---the outcome, and it is the only one available for the encounters the client never credits
---— see `resolveEncounters`. nil for a boss no lockout mentions, which is not the same as
---false: a dungeon leaves no save, so nothing is claimed either way.
