---One appearance in a saved set, and where on the character it sits.
---
---`slot` is the client's own `TransmogSlot`: 0 head, 1 shoulder, 2 back, 3 chest, 4 body,
---5 tabard, 6 wrist, 7 hand, 8 waist, 9 legs, 10 feet, 11 main hand, 12 off hand. It is
---carried rather than worked out again downstream because it is the only thing that answers
---which hand a one-hander goes in — a question the game's display types cannot settle, and
---one the app otherwise has to guess at.
---
---`appearance` is a *source* id, an `ItemModifiedAppearance` row, which is the same number the
---app already stores against a piece of a set of its own. That is what lets a set read out of
---the game and a set assembled in the app end up drawn by the same code.
---@class CustomSetSlotState
---@field slot integer
---@field appearance integer
---@field secondary integer? The second appearance a slot can carry, where it carries one.
---@field illusion integer? The enchant illusion on a weapon, likewise.

---One of the player's own transmog sets, as the game holds it.
---@class CustomSetState
---@field id integer The client's id for the set, which survives a rename.
---@field name string What the player called it.
---@field icon integer? The file id of the picture the game shows it under.
---@field slots CustomSetSlotState[] What is in it, ascending by slot.

---Keeps the last look at the player's own transmog sets, so the app can be told about them.
---@class CustomSetSnapshot
---@field sync fun(at: integer?): CustomSetState[] Take a look, and file it if it says anything new.

---@class CustomSetSnapshotDeps
---@field readSets fun(): CustomSetState[]? Every set the account has right now.
---@field store table Where the last look is kept, so a logout still has it to write out.
---@field now fun(): integer

---An empty slot reports `Constants.Transmog.NoTransmogID`, which is `0`, rather than nothing
---at all. It is not an appearance and a set is not shorter for holding one, so the slot is
---dropped and the absence is the record — the same rule `EquipsetLedger` applies to the `0`
---and `1` the equipment manager reports for a slot holding nothing.

---Zero is the client's way of saying "no illusion here" as much as "no appearance here", so
