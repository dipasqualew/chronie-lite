---The kinds of thing `ns.newCensus` knows how to take a census of.
---
---Every domain in here is the same three seams — what to walk, what one position says, and how
---to check the answer cheaply — over the client's own calls and nothing else. Adding the next
---one is a function in this file and a line in `ns.censusDomains`; nothing in `Census.lua`
---changes, and nothing downstream of it does either.
---
---**Two rules hold across all of them, and both are about not touching what the player owns.**
---
---Nothing here changes a filter, expands a header or selects a category. `HoldingsSweep` walks
---the currency and reputation *panes* and documents the holes that leaves — a collapsed group,
---and every legacy reputation, which the pane hides by default — because the calls that would
---open them up rearrange a pane the player arranged. The domains here reach the same facts
---without a pane: `C_MountJournal.GetMountIDs`, `GetAchievementInfo`,
---`C_CurrencyInfo.GetCurrencyInfo` and `C_Reputation.GetFactionDataByID` all answer about ids,
---and an id has no idea what the player has the interface set to. `ns.currencyCensus` and
---`ns.reputationCensus` are that difference at its plainest — the same currencies the sweep next
---door can only see when the player has the group open, and the legacy factions it cannot see at
---all.
---
---And nothing here writes down what the account does *not* hold. The catalogue of everything
---that exists lives in the game's own tables, which the desktop already reads — `Achievement` is
---13,732 rows in `achievements.rs`, `ItemAppearance` is 55,198 in `wardrobe.rs`. A census that
---also recorded every absence would be several times the size and would say nothing the desktop
---could not work out by subtraction.

---A count worth writing down, or nothing.
---
---Nought is the client's answer for "no cap", "nothing earned yet" and "no weekly" alike, and a
---census writes a key per id per character — so a nought written down is a saved file spent
---saying what its absence already said. Every reader of these defaults them back to nought.
---@param value any
---@return integer?

end

---Mounts: everything the account can summon.
---
---`GetMountIDs` hands over every mount in the game and `GetMountInfoByID` says of each whether
---this account has it, so a mount's position is simply its id. Both are indifferent to the
---journal's filters — the filtered pair is `GetNumDisplayedMounts`/`GetDisplayedMountID`, which
---is what Blizzard's own `MountJournal_UpdateMountList` draws the list from and what this
---deliberately is not.
---
---**No counter, on purpose.** `C_MountJournal.GetNumMounts` exists and would be the obvious one,
---but Blizzard's own journal calls it and then counts collected mounts by walking the ids anyway,
---which leaves its meaning genuinely ambiguous — and a counter whose meaning is guessed would
---provoke a pass every login or, worse, suppress one that was needed. It costs nothing to do
---without: the whole walk is about 1,900 calls, a fraction of a second at the census budget, so
---mounts are simply walked whenever anything else provokes a pass.

---Pets: every battle pet the account owns, counted by species.
---
---**The one collectible the game lets somebody own several of**, which is why this is the only
---domain whose entry carries a count. `GetOwnedPetIDs` hands over one GUID per *pet* and a
---collection is counted in *species* — three Mechanical Squirrels are one line of the pet journal
---and three positions of this walk — so the id an entry is filed under is the species and the
---pets of it are folded together as the walk meets them.
---
---`C_PetJournal.GetNumCollectedInfo(speciesID)` is where the count comes from rather than a tally
---of what the walk has seen, and the difference shows in exactly the case this whole design is
---built around: a pass a logout cuts short still says how many of a species the account has,
---instead of how many of them it got as far as. It is also the number `Main.lua` already asks for
---in the `NEW_PET_ADDED` handler, so the two halves of the record agree by construction.
---
---**The GUIDs are the account's own pets rather than the journal's list**, which is the same
---distinction `ns.mountCensus` makes: the filtered pair here is
---`GetNumPets`/`GetPetInfoByIndex` — what Blizzard's own `PetJournal_UpdatePetList` draws from,
---with `SetSearchFilter` beside it — and `GetOwnedPetIDs` takes no filter and answers about what
---is owned.
---
---`GetPetInfoTableByPetID` rather than the seventeen-return `GetPetInfoByPetID`, because it is the
---one of the pair the client's own `PetJournalInfo` documentation describes: named fields cannot
---be read off by one position the way a positional list silently can.
---
---**No counter, and the free one is a trap.** `#GetOwnedPetIDs()` costs nothing and counts *pets*,
---while `held` counts *species* — so on any account that owns two of anything the counter would
---sit permanently above what is written down and provoke a full pass at every login, forever. A
---counter that is counting a different set from the one stored is worse than none, which is the
---reason `ns.mountCensus` does without one too.

---Toys: what the account can pull out of the toy box.
---
---**Partial, and for a reason that could not be settled from the install.** `GetNumToys` is the
---unfiltered total and `GetNumFilteredToys` its filtered twin, but there is only one indexer —
---`GetToyFromIndex(itemIndex)` — and Blizzard's own `blizzard_toybox.lua` on 12.0.5.67823 pairs it
---with the *filtered* count in both places it uses it, `ToySpellButton_UpdateButton` and
---`ToyBox_FindPageForToyID`. So the list this walks is very probably the one the player's own
---filters left standing, and a walk of it can never claim to have seen every toy.
---
---That claim is the only thing at stake, because everything else here is filter-proof: the walk
---never sets a filter, `PlayerHasToy(itemID)` answers about an id whatever the toy box is showing,
---and a reading that never claims completeness can never delete anything. Being wrong the other
---way — calling it complete and pruning — would empty the record of every toy the player had
---filtered out of view. Toys are a grow-only collection, so what `partial` costs is nothing at
---all, and lifting it later is one line: **what would settle it** is a running client with a
---restrictive filter set in the toy box, comparing `C_ToyBox.GetNumToys()` and
---`C_ToyBox.GetNumFilteredToys()` against what `GetToyFromIndex` walks out.
---
---The bound is still the unfiltered total. It is the larger of the two, so nothing the player has
---left visible falls outside it, and a position past the end of the list costs one call that
---answers `-1` — which is what Blizzard's own button code checks for.
---
---**No counter.** `GetNumLearnedDisplayedToys` is the obvious one and is filter-dependent by its
---own name, which makes it exactly the kind of counter `docs/account-census.md` argues is worse
---than none: it would fall below `held` the moment somebody narrowed the pane. A partial domain is
---never settled by an audit in any case — it is walked once a session, which is what unions the
---player's various filterings together over time.

---Heirlooms: what the account has bought once and every character after can wear.
---
---`GetHeirloomItemIDs` is the only enumerator in `C_Heirloom` that does not say "Displayed" in its
---name — the pane's pair is `GetNumDisplayedHeirlooms`/`GetHeirloomItemIDFromDisplayedIndex`,
---which is what Blizzard's own `HeirloomsMixin:SortHeirloomsIntoEquipmentBuckets` draws its list
---from, with a class filter, a spec filter and a search box in front of it.
---
---**Partial all the same, for the reason `ns.toyCensus` is.** Nothing in Blizzard's own interface
---calls `GetHeirloomItemIDs`, so nothing in the install says whether it answers past the pane's
---filters; the naming is the whole of the evidence, and the toy box next door is a live
---counter-example to naming as evidence — `GetToyFromIndex` says neither "filtered" nor
---"displayed" and is used against the filtered count. Heirlooms are a grow-only collection, so
---refusing to prune costs nothing, while pruning on a filtered list would take out every heirloom
---the player had narrowed out of view. **What would settle it** is a running client with a class
---filter set in the heirloom pane: `#C_Heirloom.GetHeirloomItemIDs()` against
---`C_Heirloom.GetNumHeirlooms()` and `C_Heirloom.GetNumDisplayedHeirlooms()`.
---
---`GetNumKnownHeirlooms` rides along as the counter even so. It settles nothing — a partial domain

---Titles: what this character may put before or after their name.

---**Character-scoped, and the plainest case of it in the file.** A title is earned by whoever

---exactly: kept per `Name-Realm`, and a complete walk prunes that character's rows and nobody

---

---`PaperDollTitlesPane_Update` walks, and this walks it the same way — including the
---`playerTitle` return, which is what that pane requires before it will draw a row: a mask the
---client knows but does not call a player title is not a title anybody can wear, and a list
---carrying one would disagree with the pane the player is looking at.
---
---**The name is stored trimmed, and which side it goes on is stored beside it.** The client hands

---Achievements: what the account has earned, and which character earned it.
---
---This is the domain that pays for the whole mechanism, because the client answers a question
---here that nothing else can be asked. `GetAchievementInfo` reports `completed` for the
---**account** and `wasEarnedByMe` for the character in front of it, and hands over `earnedBy` —
---the name of the alt that actually did it — beside them. So one character, in one pass, reports
---the entire account's achievement history *and* attributes each of them. Nothing has to be
---unioned across the roster and nothing waits for an alt to be logged in.
---
---**The walk is by category, because there is no id list.** `GetCategoryList` names the trees,
---`GetCategoryNumAchievements` says how deep each is, and `GetAchievementInfo(category, index)`
---returns the whole row — id included. So the plan is drawn with about eighty calls and then a
---position is one call rather than two, which is the difference between 13,700 reads and 27,400.
---
---`GetNumCompletedAchievements(guildView)` is the counter, and its meaning is settled rather than
---assumed: Blizzard's own `Blizzard_AchievementUI` reads it as `numAchievements, numCompleted`,
---so the second return is the account's completed total in a single call. That one comparison is
---what lets a thirteen-thousand-call pass be something that happens when it is needed instead of
---something that happens every day.

---The highest currency id the walk asks about.
---
---`C_CurrencyInfo` has no enumerator. There is no `GetCurrencyIDs` and no counter, and the one
---call that hands over a list of ids — `GetPlayerCurrencyCategoryInfo` — is keyed by a category
---id that is itself only in the game's own tables. So the positions are a range, and a range needs
---an end.
---
---`CurrencyTypes` on build 12.0.5.67823 is 1,490 rows running from 42 to 3513, read out of the
---install with `Db2::parse` the way `currencies.rs` reads it for icons. Five thousand is that top
---id and half again, which is the headroom a patch's worth of new currencies has to fit into: an
---id above this is invisible to the walk, and a walk that cannot see it will still say it is
---complete. That is the one hole left here, it is bounded, and raising the number is free —
---5,000 reads is twenty-five slices, a fraction of a second, against the achievement walk's minute.
local LAST_CURRENCY_ID = 5000

---Currencies: what this character is holding of each, and how much more it may hold.
---
---**Character-scoped, and the first domain that is.** Every other domain here answers the same on
---any character, which is why they are kept once; a wallet is the opposite, and two alts with a
---wallet each must not read as one alt whose wallet keeps being replaced.
---
---This is the domain that removes a trade rather than making one. `ns.readHoldings` walks the
---currency *pane*, and a currency under a collapsed group is invisible to it — the call that would
---open the group up, `C_CurrencyInfo.ExpandCurrencyList`, rearranges something the player
---arranged, and doing that from a logout handler where nothing can be put back was the worse of
---two bad options. `GetCurrencyInfo(id)` takes an arbitrary id and answers about it completely, so
---there is no pane, no expansion, no filter, and nothing of the player's touched.
---
---It also carries what the pane row does not. `maxQuantity` and `maxWeeklyQuantity` beside
---`totalEarned` and `quantityEarnedThisWeek` are what make "am I capped" and "have I done my
---weekly" answerable at all, which no amount of watching a balance change ever could.
---
---**No counter.** Nothing in `C_CurrencyInfo` counts what is held — `GetCurrencyListSize` counts
---the rows the pane is drawing, which is the very number this domain exists not to trust. So this
---one is never distrusted into a pass of its own and is walked when something else provokes one,
---which is what `ns.newCensus` already does for mounts.

---The highest faction id the walk asks about.
---
---`C_Reputation` enumerates the reputation *pane* and nothing else. `GetNumFactions` counts the
---rows it is drawing, which is the very number this domain exists not to trust — every legacy
---reputation is missing from it, because the pane hides them unless the player has asked
---otherwise, and `SetLegacyReputationsShown` would fix that by rearranging a pane the player
---arranged. So the positions are a range, and a range needs an end.
---
---`Faction` on build 12.0.5.67823 is 860 rows running from 1 to 2793, which is the table
---`docs/game-tables.json` already registers and `reputations.rs` already reads. Four thousand is
---that top id and half again — the same headroom `LAST_CURRENCY_ID` leaves, for the same reason:
---an id above this is invisible to the walk and the walk would still call itself complete. It is
---bounded, and raising it is free, 4,000 reads being twenty slices.
local LAST_FACTION_ID = 4000

---Reputations: where this character stands with every faction the game has.
---
---**This is the domain that reaches the legacy reputations**, which is most of the game's
---factions and none of what `ns.readHoldings` can see. That walk reads the reputation pane, and
---the pane hides legacy factions by default; `GetFactionDataByID` takes an arbitrary id and
---answers for it whether the pane is drawing it, hiding it, or has it folded under a collapsed
---expansion header. Nothing of the player's is touched, which is the rule the whole file keeps.
---
---**Character-scoped**, like the wallet next door and for the same reason: a standing is one
---character's, and two alts at different renown must not read as one alt whose standing keeps
---being replaced. `accountWide` is the exception the client itself draws — a warband reputation
---is one standing every character reports, and counting it once per alt is the mistake the
---warband gold pot exists to avoid.
---
---**Filed under the id, and the id is the whole point.** A faction's name is localised, so a
---store keyed on one forks the moment somebody plays in another language, and the desktop had
---to enter the game's tables through `Faction`'s name column to find out anything else about a
---faction it had only been given a string for.
---
---The four-ladder reduction is `ns.readFactionStanding`'s, reused rather than reimplemented:
---renown, paragon, friendship and the classic reaction ladder disagree about everything, and
---that function is what makes two characters' standings comparable at all.
---
---**No counter.** `GetNumFactions` counts pane rows, so it is not a count of this at all — it is
---the number this domain refuses to believe. So reputations are never distrusted into a pass of
---their own and are walked when something else provokes one, exactly as currencies are.
---
---A position costs more here than anywhere else — up to four client calls, because a faction that
---answers at all is then asked whether it is a major one, a friendship and a paragon — and the
---budget in `Census.lua` is sized for exactly that: it is a frame budget rather than a batch size,
---small enough that a domain whose reads are several times an ordinary one's still cannot drop a
---frame. Two thirds of the range are not factions and cost one call and no more.

---The highest appearance category the walk asks about.
---
---`C_TransmogCollection` has no enumerator for its categories either — nothing hands over a list,
---and `GetCategoryInfo(category)` answers about one at a time. What the categories *are* is
---`Enum.TransmogCollectionType`, which on build 12.0.5.67823 runs 0 to 29: 0 is `None`, 1 to 11
---the armour slots down the body, and 12 to 29 everything held in a hand, wands through paired
---weapons. Read out of the client's own `TransmogSharedDocumentation` rather than off the wiki.
---
---Forty is that top value with a patch's worth of headroom, and the headroom costs eleven calls
---once per pass rather than eleven positions to walk — but only through `categoryExists` below,
---which is what makes those eleven calls survivable at all.
local LAST_TRANSMOG_CATEGORY = 40

---Whether the build has this category, asked in the one way that does not end the login.
---
---**The headroom above was written on a premise the client does not honour.** Every other bounded
---walk in this file — currencies, achievements — is over ids the client answers *nothing* about
---when nothing sits at them, so reaching past the end is free. `GetCategoryInfo` is not one of
---those. Its argument is a declared enum rather than an arbitrary id, and an id above the top of
---`Enum.TransmogCollectionType` is not a category it declines to describe, it is an argument it
---refuses: the C function raises `bad argument #1` with its own usage string. That error came out
---of the probe, out of the walk, out of `audit`, and out of the login handler that provoked the
---first census of the session — issue #271, thrown at 30 on the first id past the end of a
---thirty-value enum.
---
---So a raise and a nil are read as the same answer, which is the answer the range was always
---written expecting: there is no such category, skip it. Catching rather than shortening the
---range is deliberate. The point of the headroom is a category this build has and the number in
---this file has never heard of, and only the client can say where its own enum stops — a boundary
---moving either way is then a call that answers or a call that does not, rather than a walk that
---silently misses a slot or takes the addon down again.

    local ok, name = pcall(categoryInfo, category)

end

---Appearances: every look the account has collected, keyed by the client's own `visualID`.
---
---**The largest thing the census can light up, and the one that is only ever half an answer.**
---`wardrobe.rs` reads all 55,198 appearances of a shipping install out of `ItemAppearance` and
---`transmog.rs` reads the sets that name them; neither knows whether the reader owns any of it, so
---a look ten years in the wardrobe is drawn exactly like one nobody has ever seen.
---
---`GetCategoryAppearances(category [, transmogLocation])` is what closes that — the second
---argument is optional, which the client's own usage string says outright, so there is no
---transmog location to build and no slot of the player's to name. One call per category answers
---for every appearance in it with its `visualID` and its `isCollected`, which is about thirty
---calls against a walk of fifty-five thousand.
---
---**Partial by construction, and that is the whole design rather than a defect in it.** The
---client answers this question through the *class filter*, which is the logged-in character's
---class unless somebody has changed it: a mage is not shown plate. Issue #250 settled which way
---out to take — the account's wardrobe is the union of what its characters can each see, built up
---as they are played, rather than something one character forces by driving
---`C_TransmogCollection.SetClassFilter` over all thirteen classes and leaving the player's own
---wardrobe filtered to somebody else's class if the session ends mid-walk. So the domain is
---marked `partial`: it never claims to be whole, is never pruned, and is walked once a session,
---which is what lets a paladin's login add the plate a mage's could not see.
---
---**Which also settles what the player's filters can do to it, which is nothing.** Whether
---`GetCategoryAppearances` applies the collected, source-type and faction filters in the client or
---leaves them to Lua could not be settled from the install — Blizzard's own
---`WardrobeItemsCollectionMixin:FilterVisuals` on this build filters `isHideVisual` and no more,
---which points the other way from what the call's name suggests. It does not matter here. Every
---one of those filters can only ever make the returned list *smaller*, a smaller list is a smaller
---set of positive observations, and a reading that never claims completeness can never delete
---anything on the strength of one. Nothing here reads a filter, and — as everywhere else in this
---file — nothing here writes one.
---
---`GetCategoryCollectedCount(category)` is the counter, and it is the unfiltered one: the client
---keeps a `GetFilteredCategoryCollectedCount` beside it, which is what Blizzard's own progress bar
---under the wardrobe grid draws. Summed over the categories it is the client's own opinion of how
---much of this the account has, against which `held` is how much of it the roster has managed to
---show us — which is the one honest measure of how far the union has got.
---
---A hidden visual is not written down. Those are the "hide helm" pseudo-appearances rather than
---looks anybody collected, they answer to no row of `ItemAppearance` a reader would recognise, and
---Blizzard's own list drops them before drawing it.
