---One boss within a lockout.
---@class Encounter
---@field name string
---@field killed boolean

---A lock the client reports, normalised for storage.
---
---`key` names the *activity* — the lockable thing — and is what a lockout is filed under.
---Everything else is either a fact about the activity or a fact about this character's
---particular save.
---@class Lockout
---@field key string Identity of the activity, non-localised wherever the client allows it.
---@field activity string Localised name of the activity.
---@field kind "raid"|"dungeon"|"world_boss"
---@field difficultyId integer Stable, non-localised difficulty key. Zero when there is none.
---@field difficulty string Localised difficulty name, e.g. "10 Player (Heroic)".
---@field maxPlayers integer
---@field isRaid boolean
---@field expiry integer Absolute unix time the lockout resets.
---@field encounters Encounter[] Boss list in journal order.

---@class LockoutScanner
---@field scan fun(): Lockout[]

---@class LockoutScannerDeps
---@field getNumSavedInstances fun(): integer
--- Returns: name, lockoutId, reset, difficultyId, locked, extended, instanceIDMostSig,
--- isRaid, maxPlayers, difficultyName, numEncounters, encounterProgress, extendDisabled, instanceId
---@field getSavedInstanceInfo fun(index: integer): ...
--- Returns: bossName, fileDataID, isKilled
---@field getSavedInstanceEncounterInfo fun(instanceIndex: integer, encounterIndex: integer): ...
---@field getNumSavedWorldBosses fun(): integer?
--- Returns: name, worldBossID, reset
---@field getSavedWorldBossInfo fun(index: integer): ...
---@field now fun(): integer Unix time.

---Identity of an instance lockout: the instance name alone, deliberately. Being saved to a
---raid at one difficulty bars the others too, so keying per difficulty would report a locked
---character as free at the sibling size.
---@param name string
---@return string
local function instanceKey(name)

---Identity of a world boss. The client's numeric id when it has one, because that survives a
---locale change; the name only as a fallback.

---Reads every lock the client knows this character is under.
---
---`reset` from both APIs is SECONDS REMAINING, not a timestamp. It is only meaningful
---relative to the moment of the scan, so it is converted to an absolute expiry here — that
---conversion is the whole reason cross-character data works at all.
