---The shape of every list-valued field a segment carries, in one place. Both the tally
---(when it builds a summary) and the log (when it files a record) copy these lists out of
---live state into fresh tables, and every event type used to mean editing the copy logic
---in both. Declaring the keys once, here, means a new event type is a single line rather
---than two parallel hand-written copies that can silently drift apart.
---
---Each entry lists exactly the keys that survive a copy. Keys absent from an event are
---left absent in the copy — never invented — so an optional flag like `accountFirst` only
---appears when the source actually carried it. Listing the keys explicitly (rather than a
---blind shallow copy) also stops internal bookkeeping fields from leaking into a record.
---
---A named key holding a spec of its own — `items = { ... }` — is a list of tables nested
---inside the event, copied by the same rules one level down. Only equipment set changes
---need it today, and they genuinely do: what changed about a set is a list of slots, and
---flattening it into the parent would lose which slot went with which item.
