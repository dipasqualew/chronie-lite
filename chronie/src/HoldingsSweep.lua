---@field reputation table[] `{ id, faction, accountWide, standing, current, max, rank, system }`

---Reads a currency the pane is showing, or nothing when the row is not one.
---
---A header — the collapsible group titles the Currency tab draws between the currencies —
---comes back through the same call as a currency does, with `isHeader` set and a
---`currencyID` of 0. Both are checked rather than either: the flag is what the client
---means by it, and the id is what the store is keyed on, so a row without one is unusable
---even if the client never called it a header.
---
---`isAccountWide` is what says the quantity beside it is the **warband's** pot rather than
---this character's share of it — the client hands every character on the account the same
---number through this same call, so nothing downstream can tell the two apart by looking at
---the number. It is the client's own distinction rather than one invented here: build
---12.0.5.67823 carries the field on the row and exposes
---`C_CurrencyInfo.IsAccountWideCurrency(currencyID)` beside it, and keeps
---`isAccountTransferable` / `IsAccountTransferableCurrency` as a separate pair for the
---crest-like currencies that stay per-character but can be moved between them at a cost.
---Those are genuinely each character's own and are summed like anything else.

---Everything the character is holding, read off the client's own panes rather than out of
---what the addon happened to watch it earn.
---
---`HoldingsStore` is fed from finished segments, and a segment only ever knows about a
---currency the client announced a change to or a faction it announced a gain with. That
---makes a fresh install's account totals a set of holes that fill in one currency per
---character over weeks of play: an alt sitting on 5,000 Flightstones contributes nothing
---to the account's Flightstones until the next time it earns one. Walking the two panes at
---login and at logout is what closes them, and it needs nothing downstream to change,
---because what comes back is the same shape a segment summary hands over.
---
---**What it still cannot see.** Both walks read the pane as the player has it set up, and
---neither touches those settings. A currency under a collapsed group, a reputation under a
---collapsed expansion header, and — the big one — every legacy reputation, which the pane
---hides by default, are all invisible to the walk. Build 12.0.5.67823 has the calls that
---would open them up (`C_CurrencyInfo.ExpandCurrencyList`,
---`C_Reputation.ExpandAllFactionHeaders`, `C_Reputation.SetLegacyReputationsShown`), but
---every one of them rearranges a pane the player arranged, and doing that from a logout
---handler where nothing can be put back is a worse trade than a hole. So the walk reads
---what is on show, and what is hidden stays as incomplete as it was before.
---
---**Both holes are covered elsewhere now, and this walk is still worth its keep.**
---`ns.currencyCensus` asks `C_CurrencyInfo.GetCurrencyInfo` about ids rather than about pane
---rows, so it reaches every currency including the ones under a collapsed group, and carries
---the caps besides; `ns.reputationCensus` asks `C_Reputation.GetFactionDataByID` the same way,
---which is what finally reaches the legacy reputations. What neither can be is *here*: a census
---is spread a slice per frame and so cannot finish inside a logout handler, and this is the
---freshest reading there will ever be of a character about to stop answering. So they are
---complementary rather than one replacing the other — this one is live and shallow, those are
---complete and occasional, and they are kept in tables of their own for exactly that reason.
