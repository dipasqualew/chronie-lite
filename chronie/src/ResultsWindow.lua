---A small, draggable HUD panel that renders the current segment's SegmentSummary.
---Deliberately thin: it lays out font strings and remembers where it was dragged, and
---nothing else.
---@class ResultsWindow
---@field show fun()
---@field hide fun()
---@field toggle fun()
---@field isShown fun(): boolean
---@field update fun(summary: SegmentSummary, view: SegmentView?) Repaint; builds the frame on
---first use. The view, when there is one, says which of several the panel is standing on,
---and is what names the header.

---@class ResultsWindowDeps
---@field createFrame fun(frameType: string, name: string?, parent: table?, template: string?): table
---@field uiParent table
---@field name string Unique global frame name.
---@field formatMoney fun(copper: integer): string
---@field loadPoint fun(): (string?, number?, number?) Saved point, x, y — or nil for the default spot.
---@field savePoint fun(point: string, x: number, y: number) Persist a dragged position.
---@field openAchievement fun(id: integer)?
---@field previewTransmog fun(itemID: integer)?
---@field openTransmogCollection fun(sourceID: integer)?
---@field previewTransmogSet fun(itemID: integer, sources: integer[])? The whole set on the body
---at once, for the shifted click.
---@field openTransmogSet fun(setID: integer)? The set's own page in the collections journal, for
---the shifted right click.
---@field transmogSet fun(sourceID: integer?): TransmogSetMembership? Which set a collected
---appearance belongs to and how far into it the account is. Nil for the appearances that belong
---to none, which is most of them, and the row is drawn exactly as it always was.
---@field shiftDown fun(): boolean? Whether shift is held at the moment of a click. Injected
---rather than read off the client here, because it is the only thing that tells the panel's
---four transmog actions apart and a test cannot hold a key down.
---@field itemName fun(itemID: integer): string?
---@field now fun(): integer? Current time, for saying how old an account-wide figure is.
---@field accountStanding fun(factionID: integer): StandingRollup? Where the account as a whole
---stands with a faction, so a gain can say who holds the highest standing anybody has reached
---with it — and whether a grind is already finished elsewhere.
---@field accountCurrency fun(id: integer): CurrencyRollup? What the whole account holds of a
---currency, so a gain can be read against the balance it lands on.
---@field character fun(): string? "Name-Realm" of whoever is playing, so the reading the
---client just gave for them replaces the stale one their last logout filed. Left out where the
---panel is drawing a filed record rather than the segment being played: nobody is at the
---keyboard of a segment that ended an hour ago.
---@field tooltip table? The global GameTooltip. Given one, a faction opens the whole account's
---standings with it on hover; without one the panel simply has nothing to hover.
---@field title string|fun(summary: SegmentSummary): string?
---@field views fun(): SegmentView[]? Everything the panel could be pointed at, read when the
---picker is opened rather than held, because a segment closes while the panel is on screen.
---@field select fun(key: string)? Point the panel at one of them. Given both this and
---`views`, the title becomes the picker's button; given neither, it is only a title.
---@field closable boolean?
