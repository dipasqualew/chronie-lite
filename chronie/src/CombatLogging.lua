---Turning the client's combat log on, and saying honestly whether it went on.
---
---Two switches, not one. `LoggingCombat(true)` produces a file; the `advancedCombatLogging`
---CVar — the Advanced Combat Logging box in the Network options — is what puts positions,
---map ids and facing into the lines of it. A log without the second is close to useless for
---anything that wants to know where the player was standing, so "logging is on" is not the
---question worth answering and this module never answers only that.
---
---Neither switch is trusted to have worked. `SetCVar` does nothing from insecure code for
---the CVars Blizzard protects and raises on others, and no list of which those are holds
---across patches — so the value is written and then read back, and whatever the read says is
---what gets reported. The same for logging itself. That way the player is told what the
---client actually did rather than what the addon asked it to do.
---@class CombatLogging
---@field apply fun(): CombatLoggingState Assert the requested state, then report the real one.
---@field state fun(): CombatLoggingState Report the real one, changing nothing.
---@field describe fun(state: CombatLoggingState): string What to tell the player about it.

---What the client is really doing, read back after the asking.
---@class CombatLoggingState
---@field requested boolean Whether the desktop app's setting asked for logging at all.
---@field logging boolean Whether the client says it is writing a combat log.
---@field advanced boolean Whether the advanced CVar is on, which is what puts positions in it.

---@class CombatLoggingDeps
---@field settings table The installed settings table; `combatLogging` is the field read.
---@field loggingCombat fun(enable: boolean?): boolean Client LoggingCombat: sets when passed
---a value, and reports the current state either way.
---@field getCVar fun(name: string): string? Client GetCVar.
---@field setCVar fun(name: string, value: string): any Client SetCVar. May fail, silently or
---by raising, when the CVar is protected — which is the whole reason for the read-back.
