---Where a character currently sits with one faction, reduced to the three things a
---progress bar needs: what the level is called, how far into it the character is, and how
---long the level is. Everything the client's four different reputation systems disagree
---about is resolved here.
---@class FactionStanding
---@field id integer? The faction's own id, when the standing was read off a faction the client
---named rather than worked out from a bare set of numbers. **This is what a standing is filed
---under**, everywhere one is filed: a name is localised, so a client language change would fork
---the store into a second row for the same faction under a German spelling, and the desktop
---would have to join the game's own tables on a string to find out anything else about it.
---@field name string? What the client called that faction, kept beside the id for something to
---draw. Never keyed on.
---@field accountWide boolean? True when the standing belongs to the warband rather than to the
---character it was read on — the reputation equivalent of a shared currency pot, and absent
---rather than false for the ordinary faction, so a key per faction saying "no" costs nothing.
---@field standing string? The level's name — "Honored", "Renown 12", "Best Friend".
---@field current integer Progress into the current level, never past its end.
---@field max integer Reputation the level takes to finish; 0 when the client offered none.
---@field rank integer? How far up this faction's own ladder the level sits; see below.
---@field system string? Which ladder that is: "renown", "paragon", "friendship", "reaction".

---Clamps a bar into shape. The client can report a standing below the level's own floor
---for a heartbeat after a level-up, and a value past its ceiling while a paragon reward
---waits to be collected; either would draw a bar running off its own ends.
---
---`rank` is what makes two characters' standings with the same faction comparable, which
---is the only thing a name cannot do: "Renown 12" and "Honored" do not sort, and nothing
---in the client says which of them is further along. It is only ever meaningful against
---the same faction on the same ladder, which is why `system` travels with it — a rank
---read off the reaction ladder runs 1 to 8 while a friendship's runs into the thousands,
---and comparing the two would call the smaller number the worse standing.
---@param label string?
---@param current number?
---@param max number?
---@param rank number? Monotone within one faction's ladder; higher is further along.
---@param system string? Which ladder `rank` was read from.
---@return FactionStanding?

---Reduces whatever the client knows about one faction to a single bar.
---
---Four systems answer this question and none of them share a shape. A major faction
---(Dragonflight onwards) counts renown levels and reports its own progress; a paragon
---faction has run out of levels and instead fills the same bar over and over for a
---reward; a friendship counts ranks with names of its own; and everything else is the
---classic reaction ladder, whose bar is the slice of the total between the current
---level's floor and the next one's. They are tried in that order because a faction can
---answer to more than one — a paragon faction still reports Exalted on the ladder, and
---reporting Exalted's permanently full bar over the paragon progress would hide the only
---part of it that still moves.
---
---A level with no next one — Exalted, the last friendship rank — has no bar to fill, so
---it is drawn full rather than empty: the character is at the end of the track, not at
---the start of it.

---The function `source[name]`, or nil when this client build does not have it.

---Finds one faction's data table by the name the chat message called it.
---
---Three roads, tried cheapest first, because a chat line carries a localised name and
---everything downstream is filed under an id.
---
---**By name**, where the client offers it. One call, and the whole question — but
---`GetFactionDataByName` is not on every build, and it was already missing in issue #44.
---
---**By id**, where something has been able to turn the name into one. That is
---`ns.newFactionIndex`, handed in as `resolveFaction` and answering nil until it has walked;
---`GetFactionDataByID` then answers for the faction whatever the pane is doing with it. This is
---the road that reaches a legacy faction and one folded under a collapsed header, which is
---most of the game's factions and none of what the walk below can see.
---
---**By walking the pane**, last and unconditionally: it costs a call per row on show, it
---answers immediately where the two roads above have not yet, and on the first gain of a
---session it is the only one of the three that can. A faction none of them reaches leaves the
