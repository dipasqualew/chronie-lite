---piece of a set and whether the account holds it.

---@field playerGUID fun(): string? UnitGUID("player"), the client's own unique character id.
---@field mapState fun(): MapPosition? Where the player is standing, when the client says.
---@field screenshot fun() Take a screenshot. Asynchronous: the file lands a moment later,
---and the addon can never see it, so nothing may wait on or confirm it. What says it
---landed is SCREENSHOT_SUCCEEDED, which the client fires for the player's own screenshot
---key just the same — see ns.newScreenshotWatch for how the two are told apart.
---@field loggingCombat fun(enable: boolean?): boolean Client LoggingCombat: starts or stops
---combat logging when passed a value, and reports the current state either way.
---Everything from here to setCVar is a way of getting a string out of the client and onto
---disk, and every one of them is optional: they are undocumented on 12.0.5 and were read out
---of the client binary, so a build that does not define one is an expected answer rather than
---a broken install. `ns.newLogProbe` is the only consumer and treats nil as "absent".
---@field logChannels fun(): LogProbeDeps The client seams the log probe writes through.
---@field getCVar fun(name: string): string? Reads a client setting.
---@field setCVar fun(name: string, value: string): any Writes one. Protected settings ignore
